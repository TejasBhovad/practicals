## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i, j;

    for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    {
        for (j = 1; j < i; j++)
        {
            printf(" ");
        }
        for (j = i; j <= 5; j++)
        {
            printf("*");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program uses two nested loops to print the pattern. The outer loop iterates over the number of rows in the pattern, and the inner loop iterates over the number of columns in each row.

The outer loop starts with i equal to 5 and decrements i by 1 each iteration. The inner loop starts with j equal to 1 and increments j by 1 each iteration.

Inside the inner loop, the program first prints i number of spaces, and then 5 - i + 1 number of asterisks. The spaces are printed first to create the indentation in the pattern, and the asterisks are printed after the spaces to create the rows of asterisks.

Finally, the program prints a newline character after each row to move to the next line.
