## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int n, i;
    long sum = 0;

    printf("Enter the value of n: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        sum += i * i;
    }

    printf("The sum of the series is %ld\n", sum);

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program reads in the value of n from the user and uses a loop to calculate the sum of the series.

The loop starts with i equal to 1 and increments i by 1 each iteration. It calculates the square of i and adds it to the sum variable, which keeps track of the total sum.

Finally, the program prints the value of sum after the loop completes.
