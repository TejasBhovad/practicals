## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find the sum of the elements in an array
int sum(int a[], int n)
{
    int i, total = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        total += a[i];
    }
    return total;
}

int main()
{
    int i, n;
    printf("Enter the number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int a[n];
    printf("Enter the elements of the array: ");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }

    int result = sum(a, n);
    printf("The sum of the elements is %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program defines a function called sum that takes an array a and the number of elements n as input, and returns the sum of the elements in the array.

The function uses a loop to iterate over the elements of the array and adds them to a total variable. It then returns the value of the total variable as the result of the function.

In the main function, the program reads in the number of elements and the elements of the array from the user, and then calls the sum function to calculate the sum of the elements. It prints the result of the function.
