## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to reverse a string
void reverse_string(char s[])
{
    int i, j, temp;
    for (i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++)
        ; // Find the length of the string
    for (i--, j = 0; j < i; i--, j++)
    {
        // Swap the characters at indices i and j
        temp = s[i];
        s[i] = s[j];
        s[j] = temp;
    }
}

int main()
{
    char s[100];
    printf("Enter a string: ");
    scanf("%s", s);

    reverse_string(s);
    printf("Reversed string: %s\n", s);

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program defines a function called reverse_string that takes a string as input and reverses it in-place (i.e., it modifies the original string).

The function uses a loop to find the length of the string by iterating over the characters until it reaches the null character, which marks the end of the string. It then uses two pointers, i and j, to iterate over the characters of the string from both ends. It swaps the characters at the corresponding indices using a temporary variable.

In the main function, the program reads in a string from the user and calls the reverse_string function to reverse it. It then prints the reversed string.
