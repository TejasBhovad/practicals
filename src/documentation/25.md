## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int n, count = 0, sum = 0;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Count the number of digits
    int temp = n;
    while (temp != 0)
    {
        count++;
        temp /= 10;
    }

    // Calculate the sum of digits
    temp = n;
    while (temp != 0)
    {
        sum += temp % 10;
        temp /= 10;
    }

    printf("Number of digits: %d\n", count);
    printf("Sum of digits: %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program uses two loops to perform the required operations. The first loop counts the number of digits in the number by iterating until the number becomes 0, and the second loop calculates the sum of the digits by adding the remainder of the number divided by 10 on each iteration.

In the main function, the program reads in a number from the user and calls the loops to perform the operations. It then prints the results.
