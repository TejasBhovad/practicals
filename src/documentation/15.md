## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main()
{
    int n, i;
    double x, sum = 0.0;

    printf("Enter the value of x (in radians): ");
    scanf("%lf", &x);
    printf("Enter the number of terms: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    double term = x;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        sum += term;
        term *= -(x * x) / (2 * i * (2 * i + 1));
    }

    printf("The sum of the sine series is %f\n", sum);

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program uses the same approach as the previous version to read in the value of x and the number of terms n from the user. However, instead of calculating the ith term of the series using the formula (-1)^(i - 1) * x^(2*i - 1) / factorial(2*i - 1), it calculates the term using the formula (-x^2 / (2*i*(2*i + 1))) \* term.

The term variable starts with the value of x and is updated on each iteration of the loop. The value of sum is updated by adding the current value of term on each iteration.

This approach allows the program to calculate the sum of the series without the need for a separate function to calculate the factorial of a number.
