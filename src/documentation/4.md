## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main()
{
    int choice, number, i;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    printf("Enter 1 to compute the square of the number\n");
    printf("Enter 2 to compute the square root of the number\n");
    printf("Enter 3 to compute the cube of the number\n");
    printf("Enter 4 to compute the prime factors of the number\n");
    scanf("%d", &choice);

    switch (choice)
    {
    case 1:
        printf("The square of %d is %d\n", number, number * number);
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("The square root of %d is %f\n", number, sqrt(number));
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("The cube of %d is %d\n", number, number * number * number);
        break;
    case 4:
        printf("The prime factors of %d are: ", number);
        while (number % 2 == 0)
        {
            printf("2 ");
            number /= 2;
        }
        for (i = 3; i <= sqrt(number); i += 2)
        {
            while (number % i == 0)
            {
                printf("%d ", i);
                number /= i;
            }
        }
        if (number > 2)
        {
            printf("%d", number);
        }
        printf("\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Invalid choice\n");
        break;
    }

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

The program first reads in a number and a choice from the user. It then uses a switch statement to execute the appropriate code based on the value of choice. The break statement at the end of each case is used to exit the switch statement and prevent the code for the remaining cases from being executed.
