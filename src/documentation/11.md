## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i, j, rows;

    printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
    scanf("%d", &rows);

    for (i = 0; i < rows; i++)
    {
        // Print leading spaces
        for (j = 0; j < rows - i - 1; j++)
        {
            printf(" ");
        }
        // Print numbers in the row
        int n = 1;
        for (j = 0; j <= i; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", n);
            n = n * (i - j) / (j + 1);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program uses the same approach as the previous version to read in the number of rows and print the leading spaces for each row. However, instead of using a separate function to calculate the binomial coefficient, it calculates the numbers in the row using a loop and the binomial coefficient formula.

The loop starts with n equal to 1 and iterates over the number of elements in the row. For each iteration, it calculates the next number in the row using the formula n = n \* (i - j) / (j + 1), where i is the current row number and j is the current element number. It then prints the current value of n and continues to the next iteration.

Finally, the program prints a newline character after each row to move to the next line
