## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i, j;

    for (i = 5; i >= 1; i--)
    {
        for (j = 1; j <= 5 - i; j++)
        {
            printf(" ");
        }
        for (j = 1; j <= i; j++)
        {
            printf("%d", j);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}


```

## Explanation:

This program uses a single loop to print the pattern. The loop iterates over the number of rows in the pattern, and prints the numbers from 1 to i for each row.

The loop starts with i equal to 5 and decrements i by 1 each iteration. Inside the loop, the program uses another loop to print the numbers from 1 to i for each row.

Finally, the program prints a newline character after each row to move to the next line.
