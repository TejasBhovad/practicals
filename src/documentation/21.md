## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Recursive function to find the factorial of a number
int factorial(int n)
{
    if (n == 0)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    else
    {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

int main()
{
    int n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int result = factorial(n);
    printf("The factorial of %d is %d\n", n, result);

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program defines a recursive function called factorial that takes a number n as input and returns the factorial of n.

The function uses a base case to stop the recursion when n is 0, and returns 1. Otherwise, it returns n multiplied by the factorial of n - 1.

In the main function, the program reads in a number from the user and calls the factorial function to calculate the factorial. It then prints the result.
