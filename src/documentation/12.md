## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i, j, rows, number = 1;

    printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
    scanf("%d", &rows);

    for (i = 1; i <= rows; i++)
    {
        for (j = 1; j <= i; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", number);
            number++;
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program reads in the number of rows from the user and uses two nested loops to print Floyd's triangle.

The outer loop iterates over the number of rows in the triangle, and the inner loop iterates over the number of elements in each row.

The inner loop starts with number equal to 1 and increments it by 1 each iteration. It then prints the current value of number and continues to the next iteration.

Finally, the program prints a newline character after each row to move to the next line.
