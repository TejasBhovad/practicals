## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i, j, k;

    for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    {
        // Print spaces
        for (j = 1; j <= 5 - i; j++)
        {
            printf(" ");
        }
        // Print asterisks
        for (k = 1; k <= 2 * i - 1; k++)
        {
            printf("*");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program uses three loops to print the pattern. The outer loop iterates over the number of rows in the pattern.

Inside the outer loop, the program uses two inner loops to print the spaces and asterisks for each row. The first inner loop prints the spaces, and the second inner loop prints the asterisks.

The number of spaces to print for each row is calculated as 5 - i, where i is the current row number. The number of asterisks to print for each row is calculated as 2 \* i - 1, where i is the current row number.

Finally, the program prints a newline character after each row to move to the next line.
