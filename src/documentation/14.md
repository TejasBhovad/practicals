## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int n, i;
    double sum = 0.0;

    printf("Enter the value of n: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        double factorial = 1.0;
        int j;
        for (j = 1; j <= i; j++)
        {
            factorial *= j;
        }
        sum += (double)i / factorial;
    }

    printf("The sum of the series is %f\n", sum);

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program reads in the value of n from the user and uses a loop to calculate the sum of the series.

The loop starts with i equal to 1 and increments i by 1 each iteration. It calculates the factorial of i using another loop, and then adds i divided by the factorial to the sum variable, which keeps track of the total sum.
