## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int marks;

    printf("Enter the marks of the student: ");
    scanf("%d", &marks);

    if (marks > 90)
    {
        printf("A\n");
    }
    else if (marks >= 65 && marks <= 89)
    {
        printf("B\n");
    }
    else if (marks >= 40 && marks <= 64)
    {
        printf("C\n");
    }
    else if (marks >= 30 && marks <= 39)
    {
        printf("D\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Fail\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program first reads in the marks of the student using the scanf function. It then uses an if-else ladder to check the range of the marks and prints out the corresponding grade.

The if statement checks if the marks are greater than 90. If they are, it prints out "A". If not, the program proceeds to the next else if statement, which checks if the marks are between 65 and 89 (inclusive). If they are, it prints out "B". The program continues in this manner until it reaches the final else statement, which is executed if none of the other conditions are met. In this case, the program prints out "Fail".
