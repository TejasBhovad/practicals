## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define N 10 // Number of players

// Football structure for a player
typedef struct
{
    char name[100];
    char country[100];
    int goals;
} Football;

// Function to sort the players according to goals
void sort_players(Football players[], int n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
    {
        int min_index = i;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
        {
            if (players[j].goals < players[min_index].goals)
            {
                min_index = j;
            }
        }
        // Swap the players at indices i and min_index
        Football temp = players[i];
        players[i] = players[min_index];
        players[min_index] = temp;
    }
}

int main()
{
    Football players[N];

    // Read in player details
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        printf("Enter player %d details:\n", i + 1);
        printf("Name: ");
        scanf("%s", players[i].name);
        printf("Country: ");
        scanf("%s", players[i].country);
        printf("Goals: ");
        scanf("%d", &players[i].goals);
    }

    // Sort the players according to goals
    sort_players(players, N);

    // Display the sorted player details
    printf("Sorted player details:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        printf("Name: %s\n", players[i].name);
        printf("Country: %s\n", players[i].country);
        printf("Goals: %d\n", players[i].goals);

## Explanation:

This program defines a Football structure that has three members: name, country, and goals. It also defines a function called sort_players that takes an array of Football structures and its size as input, and sorts the array according to the goals member using selection sort.

In the main function, the program reads in the details of N players and stores them in an array of Football structures. It then calls the sort_players function to sort the array according to the goals member. Finally, it displays the sorted player details.
