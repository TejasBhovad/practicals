## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define N 3 // Number of players

// Football structure for a player
struct Football
{
    char name[100];
    char country[100];
    int goals;
};
int main()
{
    struct Football players[N];

    // Read in player details
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        printf("Enter player %d details:\n", i + 1);
        printf("Name: ");
        scanf("%s", players[i].name);
        printf("Country: ");
        scanf("%s", players[i].country);
        printf("Goals: ");
        scanf("%d", &players[i].goals);
    }
    int tmp = 0, index;
    // Find highest Scorer
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        if (players[i].goals > tmp)
        {
            tmp = players[i].goals;
            index = i;
        }
    }

    // Display the sorted player details
    printf("Highest Scorer details:\n");
    printf("Name: %s\n", players[index].name);
    printf("Country: %s\n", players[index].country);
    printf("Goals: %d\n", players[index].goals);

    return 0;
}

## Explanation:

This program defines a Football structure that has three members: name, country, and goals. It also defines a function called sort_players that takes an array of Football structures and its size as input, and sorts the array according to the goals member using selection sort.

In the main function, the program reads in the details of N players and stores them in an array of Football structures. It then calls the sort_players function to sort the array according to the goals member. Finally, it displays the sorted player details.
