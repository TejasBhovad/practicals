## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i, n, a = 0, b = 1, c;
    printf("Enter the number of terms: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("Fibonacci series:\n");
    printf("%d ", a);
    printf("%d ", b);
    for (i = 2; i < n; i++)
    {
        c = a + b;
        printf("%d ", c);
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}

```

## Explanation:

This program uses a loop to iterate n - 2 times, starting at 2. On each iteration, it calculates the next number in the Fibonacci series by adding the previous two numbers, and prints it. It then updates the previous two numbers for the next iteration.

The program starts by printing the first two numbers of the series, 0 and 1, which are initialized at the beginning of the program.
